This Minetest mod just contains a lot of random nodes.

Some of the nodes are:
- Various realistic blocks
- Mugs, copper and tin
- A plane sphere the size of a block
- Salt and pepper shakers
- Some decorative floor nodes
- A couple bowls
- A monument to peace
- A fire hydrant

Hoping to continue adding more on an ongoing basis.
To install, just drop into your Minetest mods folder.

Please enjoy and share!
