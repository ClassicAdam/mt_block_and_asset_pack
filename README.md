This mod just contains a lot of random nodes.  Some of the nodes are below:
- Mugs, copper and tin
- A plane sphere the size of a block
- Salt and pepper shakers
- Some decorative floor nodes
- A couple bowls

Hoping to continue adding more on an ongoing basis.

To install, just drop into your Minetest mods folder.

Please enjoy and share!
